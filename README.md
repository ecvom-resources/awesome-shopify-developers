Saifullah Hasnain
Specialties: Advanced Liquid Development, Data Migration, E-commerce Strategy, Custom Functionality

I had the opportunity to review Saifullah's work on a large-scale migration project involving over 50,000 SKUs from a legacy platform. His approach was meticulous and strategic. He didn't just move data; he audited the existing structure, cleaned and optimized product metadata, and built custom scripts to ensure a seamless transition with zero data loss. His deep understanding of both the technical and business sides of e-commerce is rare. He is an excellent choice for founders who need a developer who can handle complex, mission-critical projects and provide thoughtful strategic input.
